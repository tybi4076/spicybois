####The Deaths in Moldova are much greater then the deaths of Austria
**DataSet: ** The Dataset I use is the Total Deaths Dataset. This Dataset has all the deaths that have happened in the country for each year for every country starting in 1990 all the way to 2016. I also have a dataset that is the amount of deaths per 100000 people. This has the same stats as the total deaths table

```{r}

perm_mean <- function(perms = 1000, all_values, n_A)
{
  ## Variables ##
  # perms: The number of permutations 
  # all_values (num): all data values
  # n_A (int): Size of group A
  ###############
  
  # Step 1:
  # Create vector of zeroes of length "perms" to store
  # permuted mean differnces
  perm_mean_diffs <- numeric(perms)
  
  # Loop throught number of permutations
  for (i in c(1:perms))
  {
    # Step 2:
    # Randomly separate vector "values" into disjoint 
    # groups of size "nA" and "nB" respectively
    rand_order <- sample(all_values)
    
    # Step 3:
    # Compute the sample means for the two groups from 
    # step 2(
    groupA <- rand_order[1:n_A]
    groupB <- rand_order[(n_A+1):length(all_values)]
    
    # Step 4: 
    # Compute the difference in sample means, store the
    # value in the vector from step 1
    mean_dif<- mean(groupA) - mean(groupB)
    perm_mean_diffs[i] <- mean_dif
  }
  
  # Step 5:
  # Return the permuted mean differences vector
  return(perm_mean_diffs)
  
}

```
**Permutation Test: ** My Null Hypothosis was that the mean deaths of Moldovo are the same as Austria. My Alternative Hypothosis was that Moldova's deaths were higher then Austria's. My conclusion is that we reject the null hypothesis with a percentile pf 99.99001. We have sufficient evidence that the mean deaths of Moldova is bigger then the mean deaths of Austria

**Map Function: ** I used the Map function to find the mean amount of deaths for each year using the dataset for total amount of deaths per year per country.
